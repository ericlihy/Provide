# Provide

Provide was a project completed with two partners that implements a subscription based website where people could upload their services (such as Personal Trainer, baked good delivered weekly, etc.) and other people could subscribe. Used Firebase, Stripe sellers portal, Python, and SQL.

Subcriptions could be searched for in a search bar, had tiles that displayed an image, description, price, and subscribe button on the home page. Personal profile allowed users to keep track of services they are provided but also what services they are subscribed to.

Users also had to log in with a username and password (hashed) and will raise error if they do not match. No two usernames can be the same or else an error will be raised.

Here is a video explaination on Provide and its functionality https://youtu.be/O7z0B9mRTA0
